#### Texas Native plant society class

native plant: "occurs naturally 'with no human intervention'" [i disagree]
Texas native plant: indigenous prior to Euro-American settlement [eg can be brought by Native Americans]
endemic: located in just one specific place [eg Denton County, chalky soils in Texas]

(Why does everyone care so much about Monarchs?)

It's even possible to design formal native landscapes

Dallas really does seem better for native planting than Austin, San Antonio, and Houston because it gets a good amount of water but not too much.


### Planning and Landscaping with Natives


Dallas soils:
* alfisols
* vertisols
* mollisols

limestone was laid down when texas was deep underwater
sandstone developed when texas was estuary


limestone underlies prairies
sandstone underlies cross timbers

gilgai / mima mounds


[So if I live in Dallas County not in a streambed, truly "native" endemic planting would be basically just grass, forbs?]
[How to find seasonal wind patterns?]


***
Here in North Texas, we get most of our breezes from the south in the summer time...ventilating breezes.
Instead of using a wood fence on your southern border, use a fence that allows breezes through.
Breezes also need to be able to escape.
Cold winds come mostly from NW; you may want to block those.

don't prune plants until end of february because wildlife need those spots to overwinter

local compost?

pecans are self-pruning

sedges have edges
rushes are round

potted plants in texas should be in reallly large pots and also be drought tolerant
