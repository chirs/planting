I acknowledge that before a house was built on this land, [previous owner.]

As a university, we acknowledge the many benefits we have of being in this place. It is a space we share with all living beings, human and non-
human. It is an ancient space where others have lived before us. The monument created jointly by TCU and the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes remi
nds us of our benefits, responsibilities, and relationships. We pause to reflect on its words:

This ancient land, for all our relations.

We respectfully acknowledge all Native American peoples who have lived on this land since time immemorial. TCU especially acknowledges and pays
 respect to the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes, upon whose historical homeland our university is located.
