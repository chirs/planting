	From my understanding you can always do thicker if it isn‚Äôt an area you‚Äôre immediately planting (but want to build up that soil quality)
10:01:26 From T - Laura Smith to Everyone:
	I have also done this over Bermuda. I scalped the grass with the mower and can also use a weed eater after to get it as short as possible. Then layer as indicated. I check it often and pull anything that still pops through. It‚Äôs totally manageable though.

It has more students than any other classes we have offered.  It can be done as a stand alone class with no prerequisites b/c it is very useful fo MN projects
10:02:39 From D - Birte (Bee) Fehse to Everyone:
	Just to be clear - cardboard & mulch is NOT a solarization method - solarization involves covering the soil with clear or black plastic and then waiting until everything underneath is scorched (including any microorganisms unfortunately). The cardboard method is really weed suppression & mulching - I'm not a fan of solarization precisely because it kills more than just weeds & Bermuda.

	I use Airpots all the time
10:22:21 From T - Leslie Kirwan to Everyone:
	An air pot is a type of container designed to promote healthy root growth in plants1. It works by allowing air to reach the roots, which encourages a process called air pruning1. When roots grow out of the air pot's holes and encounter air, they stop growing in that direction and instead focus on growing more roots within the soil1. This results in a healthier, more fibrous root system that is better at absorbing nutrients and water1.	Air pots are commonly used by nurseries, gardeners, and horticultural institutions to grow stronger, more resilient plants2. They are available in various sizes and are reusable, making them an eco-friendly option for plant cultivation
10:22:21 From T - Anna Potter to Everyone:
	I have tried them but not sure how effective they are

	Texas law limits the ability of homeowners associations (HOAs) to prohibit residents from using native plants in their landscaping:¬†
	
	Senate Bill 198This law restricts HOAs from enforcing rules that prohibit or restrict homeowners from using drought-resistant landscaping or water-conserving natural turf.¬†
	Property Code, Section 202.007This law prohibits HOAs from prohibiting homeowners from:¬†
	Composting¬†
	Installing rain barrels¬†
	Implementing efficient irrigation systems¬†
	Using drought-resistant landscaping or water-conserving natural turf¬†
	The state's goal is to encourage homeowners to conserve water and reduce landscaping waste. However, HOAs can still require homeowners to obtain pre-approval for aesthetic reasons.

10:59:31 From T - michelleburrows to Everyone:
	The area between the branch collar and branch ridge contain hormones that prevent pest and disease invasion. So, if you cut into, or cut off, the collar or the ridge, you damage the tree‚Äôs immune system. The ridge is on the top and is rough, the collar on the bottom.

	You can "subordinate prune" codominant stems that you want removed over time. Generally, this means progressively removing those stems over the course of a few years so too much material isn't removed at one time. Also helps with aesthetics

	In his slide for pruning dead branches, there is a "bump" just below where the cut is made. That bump is the branch collar (like Michelle stated below), which is living tissue and is where the tree has started to grow around the dead branch. Leaving this tissue will allow the tree to more quickly seal off the pruning cut

	Nurseries/landscapers commonly plant three separate trees in one pot/location to give it a multi-stemmed appearance. If it is an existing tree that has been in the ground a while, it may just be best to leave the three stems. the multi-stems are more of an issue when they originate on the same tree
